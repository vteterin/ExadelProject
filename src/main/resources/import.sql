<p>Truly excited by the idea of another entry in the Wickiverse, Reeves basically acted out how he saw the next film playing out, picking up from where <em>Chapter 2</em> left off. &quot;I think the opening of the film should be Wick just trying to escape from New York,&quot; Reeves told us. &quot;Literally trying to get off the island. Maybe he asks [Lawrence Fisburne&#39;s character] the Bowery King for help. Maybe John Leguizamo comes and helps me out. &quot;John, I can&#39;t do it, you&#39;re <em>excommunicado</em>!&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Reeves continued in an animated fashion: &quot;Maybe the High Table shows up. And then the High Table starts firing guns. And then maybe this kind of thing starts to happen between the High Table and Continental? Maybe John is the activator of this confrontation, and perhaps there&#39;s a war? Wouldn&#39;t that be awesome?!&quot;</p>
<p>Stahelski, for his part, did not go into specific details of what a third Wick outing might look like, but did tease the expansion of the shady assassin&#39;s underworld. &quot;I&#39;d say, if we were so lucky to continue the series, I&#39;d like to expand the world maybe another 25%,&quot; he explained. &quot;But then I&#39;d like to go deeper into the world that people already know – another 50%.&quot; Does this mean we get to know exactly how powerful Ian McShane&#39;s Winston is? Do we get to see Lance Reddicks&#39; Charon kick some ass? Will we get an extensive backstory for John Wick&#39;s second dog?</p>
<p><em>John Wick Chapter 3</em> is yet to be officially greenlit, of course, but the appetite for Keanu Reeves to continue dispatching baddies with pencils is certainly there. Keep your eyes (and more importantly, ears) peeled for our full <em>John Wick Chapter 2</em> Spoiler Special podcast, arriving in a podcast app near you very soon.</p>',

Women only appeared for 36% of the time that humans were seen on screen, and accounted for just 35% of speaking time. When broken down by movie rating, women were represented least in R-rated movies, appearing 34% of on-screen time. Women had the most representation in PG-rated movies, with 42% of on-screen time.</p>
<p>That speaking time drops even lower, to 27%, when looking at Academy Award-winning movies.</p>
<p>Disparity in screen time <a href="https://qz.com/658693/american-movies-are-full-of-women-who-dont-really-talk/">has been documented before</a>. A 2016 study analyzing 30 years of top-grossing films found that a disproportionate amount of films were dominated by male dialogue.</p>

<p>Google&rsquo;s tool is trained to understand gender based on looking at each actor&rsquo;s faces and voices. (Animated films and movies with masked characters were not included.) The tool is made of three algorithms: one that identifies and tracks faces throughout the movie; one that determines the faces&rsquo; gender; and then a third to determine whether a voice is male or female.</p>
<p>The Geena Davis Institute&rsquo;s CEO, Madeline Di Nonno, says this software could likely be used to analyze television for the same biases in the future.</p>
<p>And besides strong female representation <a href="https://qz.com/612086/huge-study-find-that-companies-with-more-women-leaders-are-more-profitable/">being good for corporate business</a>, it&rsquo;s good for ticket sales, as well: female-led movies tend to do <a href="https://seejane.org/research-informs-empowers/data/">16% better in the box office</a>.</p>',

<p>The film comes from a screenplay written by <a class="autolink" title="Aaron Sorkin" href="http://www.ign.com/stars/aaron-sorkin">Aaron Sorkin</a> (The Social Network).

<p>As <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/04/21/minecraft-united-nations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mashable</a> notes, the redesign effort is part of an initiative called <a href="http://blockbyblock.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Block by Block</a>. Community input is made possible by a partnership between the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) and Mojang, developers of the <a class="autolink" title="Minecraft" href="http://www.ign.com/games/minecraft/ps3-20005055">Minecraft</a> video game. The aim of the four-year program is to allow young people to design and upgrade a total of 300 public spaces by 2016.</p>
<p>The possible Plaza Tlaxcoaque makeover is one of the early projects. Three winners will present their designs, chosen from between 500 and 1000 estimated entries, on April 27, 2014. From there, the models will be turned over to architects to be turned into a real architectural design that can be presented to city officials.</p>
<p>Work on the pilot project in Nairobi is already underway, and similar efforts have begun in countries such as Haiti, India, and Nepal.</p>',

'Reviewing an MMORPG is a big job that can take weeks to complete. Our final score will be awarded at that time, once weve put in enough time to get a sense of The Elder Scrolls Onlines true strengths and weaknesses.',
'<p><strong>April 9: End-Game Bugs, Veteran Content, and the Economy</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I hit the level cap of 50 <a href="https://twitter.com/LeifJohnson/status/453410927430234112" rel="nofollow">early yesterday morning</a>, and Id intended to spend today talking about the "Veteran" content in Elder Scrolls Online – i.e., what currently passes for the end game. (The <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/07/the-elder-scrolls-online-first-content-patch-revealed">recent news about Craglorn</a> hints at better things to come.) Alas, for two day entire days now, the "Groundskeeper" NPC that unlocks so much of the content in the final zone of <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/elder-scrolls-online/Coldharbour"title="Coldharbour" >Coldharbour</a> has been bugged for the <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/elder-scrolls-online/Ebonheart_Pact"title="Ebonheart Pact" >Ebonheart Pact</a>, restricting me and seemingly hundreds of other players from experiencing Veteran content outside of Cyrodiil PvP and Veteran dungeons. So much for that.</p>
<p>Its even worse for lower-level characters, as the same NPC is bugged for them as well. At the heart of Coldharbour stands a town known as the Hollow City, and you fill it with NPCs much as you fill Mass Effects Normandy by completing quests. Since the Groundskeeper is bugged, thus keeping all the content she unlocks inaccessible, an unfortunate number of players have been led to believe that the final zone consists of nothing but grinding through <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/elder-scrolls-online/Enemies"title="enemies" >enemies</a>. I fortunately managed to complete the bulk of the Coldharbour quests before I ran into this problem, but for  now the final chapter in the main story isnt available.</p>
<p>Im especially amused that its a quintessential <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/elder-scrolls-online/Bugs_and_Glitches"title="Elder Scrolls bug" >Elder Scrolls bug</a>. Much like Karliah in unpatched versions of the end of Skyrims Thieves Guild quest, the Groundskeeper just sits there, a quest marker over her head, but she never responds no matter how often you log in or out or wait. Considering how key the NPC is, its inexcusable that she hasnt been fixed yet. Much as I said in my first review in progress, these bugs arent terribly common (or theyre usually repairable by logging out and logging back in), but the whoppers always seem to affect the most essential NPCs.</p>
<p>But anyway. Veteran levels are somewhat like Paragon levels in Diablo III, as you earn them after youve completed the main leveling content. The difference is that <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/elder-scrolls-online/Armor"title="Veteran gear" >Veteran gear</a> also has Veteran level requirements much as the standard gear. Allegedly – remember, I havent seen it – Veteran zones let you access the content of the two other factions, complete with high-level profession materials and additional skill points, thus verifying ZeniMaxs earlier claims that reaching the level cap consists of a mere one-third of the PvE content.</p>',

Anyone considering paying for Early Access to this alpha should set aside any illusions that they will actually be playing the game. GalCiv III will eventually be a 4X space strategy game. Its alpha is a 3X, at best.</p>
<p>The current build of the game lacks three huge features that havent been implemented yet, and without them, its hard to say just how well GalCiv III will end up coming together. First, the AI is non-responsive, and there is no diplomacy system to foster interaction anyway. They will occasionally build ships (more by happenstance than design) and theyre quite eager to colonize every planet under every sun. But theres nothing you can do with them except conquer them, and that will prove very, very easy.</p>',
